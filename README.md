## Technologies Used

### Axios:

Axios is a promise-based HTTP Client for node.js and the browser. It is isomorphic (= it can run in the browser and nodejs with the same codebase). On the server-side it uses the native node.js http module, while on the client (browser) it uses XMLHttpRequests.

### Visual Studio Code:

Visual Studio Code is a lightweight but powerful source code editor which runs on your desktop and is available for Windows, macOS and Linux. It comes with built-in support for JavaScript, TypeScript and Node.js and has a rich ecosystem of extensions for other languages and runtimes (such as C++, C#, Java, Python, PHP, Go, .NET). Begin your journey with VS Code with these introductory videos.

### NPM:

NPM is the world's largest software registry. Open source developers from every continent use npm to share and borrow packages, and many organizations use NPM to manage private development as well.

## Particle.js

A lightweight, dependency-free and responsive javascript plugin for particle backgrounds.
